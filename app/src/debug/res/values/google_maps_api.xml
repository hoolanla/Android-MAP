    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    EF:C0:9E:05:47:C2:42:F7:E9:8F:A3:63:CF:7A:B7:F6:3C:D7:C1:F3

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    EF:C0:9E:05:47:C2:42:F7:E9:8F:A3:63:CF:7A:B7:F6:3C:D7:C1:F3

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
